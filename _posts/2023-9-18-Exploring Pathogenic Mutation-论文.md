This paper investigates the biological effects of somatic mutations in allosteric proteins and their implications in disease progression. 

The study analyzes over 38,539 mutations across 90 human genes associated with 740 allosteric protein chains.

### Key Objectives and Features

- **Objective**: To develop a predictive model for identifying pathogenic mutations in allosteric proteins.
- **Methodology**: Utilizes an ensemble-learning approach that integrates intrinsic protein characteristics with existing prediction methods.
- **Performance**: The proposed model achieves an AUC of 0.868 and an AUPR of 0.894 on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.
- **Significance**: Identifies potential pathogenic mutations at allosteric sites, contributing to the understanding of their role in various diseases and enhancing the tools available for precision medicine.
